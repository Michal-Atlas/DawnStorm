## Spells

When casting a spell you declare,
a Motion and optionally an Element you know (collectively called words of power),
how much mana you empower the spell with (minimum 1) and what the desired outcome is.
Without a good idea of what you expect it to do,
the Motion is useless and fizzles.
Not all elements are useful with all motions.
The mechanics should be second to the player's intention,
even if it makes only a loose connection.
A spell's potency is increased by your degrees of success.

### Motion Examples

- Create + Destroy
- Join + Divide
- Kill + Heal
- Scry
- Transmute
- Summon
- Show
- Command
- Cease
- Stride

### Element Examples

If the spell doesn't contain a corresponding Element for the effect,
the potency is halved and capped at your `Magic Improvisation` skill.

- Fire / Heat
- Water
- Cold / Ice
- Earth
- Nature
- Metal
- Body
- Time
- Spectra (Supernatural)
- Necros (Necromantic)

### Characters

These both limit and flavour the spell's effects.

**Draconic** - The spell's effect is exhaled as a cone-shaped breath from the mouth

**Fey** - All effects are performed by nearby plants

**HexBlade** - The magic is limited only to the wearer himself and mainly his weapon and armour

**Artistic** - The effects must all be based on the art, animate and move small objects, or create illusions

**Shadow** -

## Magic Circles

A magic circle is created by inscribing a Motion and an Element, with a very specific intention into a solid surface.
It takes 1 second to drain 1 Mana into a circle.
At Dawn and Dusk, a circle is sealed and cannot be expanded, only recharged.
When activated, the circle casts the spell, draining from the enclosed mana pool.
If the creature that activates a circle is a magic user with a Character, the spell is cast with that character.

## Rituals

Rituals work similair to magic circles, but require certain additional sacrifices, circumstances and their inscriptions are often above the level of methods and elements.

## Analyzing Magic

Perceiving a magic circle, even an instantaneous one let's you identify any word of power that you know.
Identifying those you don't know, requires a knowledge (arcane) check and some time and concentration with the circle or a page of notes you made about it.
Learning a word of power requires several days, of study and experimentation with notes from several circles,
with a `CR` of the number of different notes you're analyzing that have a word in them that you know.
