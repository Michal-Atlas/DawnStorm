# DawnStorm - A 3D6 Pen & Paper RPG

{::options auto_ids="true" /}

- TOC_TEST
{:toc}

## Preword

I started this project with the intention of ending up with a simple RPG system,
that nonetheless felt good and was fast to play.
The second goal was to give as much freedom as possible, while keeping it simple for both the players and the GM.

When you see something colored like `THIS` it is a keyword and will be explained somewhere later on.

Some parts are labelled like
> THIS
These provide some additional suggestions, explanations or just general commentary.

The last thing is that almost all of this is built as suggestions,
I'm more than happy if the players ask politely for items not on lists,
spell words not shown and races not recommended,
that is one of the points to the game.

Now, let's get rolling.

## Skill Checks

When you need to check if you succeeded at a particular task, you roll 3D6 and if you Rolled **lower** or equal to the `Roll Difficulty` (further called `RD`) you were successfull.
Many effects will subtract or add to your roll, most commonly your Professions.
You may subtract, up to two Profession's bonuses from your roll.

> Remember, since lower is better, you subtract your bonuses from your roll

|DA||
|:---:|---|
|10|Normal|

**non-Professional checks** - If you need to check your success in an action,
that doesn't apply to any of your professions,
you may roll with a bonus of your stat divided by 3 rounded down - 1.

**Group checks** - If you need to use a skill against a crowd,
roll 4 times for the crowd,
the whole crowd is divided on the subject based on the success rate of the rolls.

## Character creation

### Race

#### Goblin

Size: `Small`

#### Isk

Size: `Large`

The Isk descend from a large tribe of giants that once descended from the mountains to live among a Keinfolk city. Over time, their stature had greatly diminished from their original, today being only about one and a half to double the size of humans and living commonly in some larger cities often as workers.

#### Keinfolk

**Kein Roar** - Once a day, you are able to Roar so loud that any creatures within a 30 meter radius, must succeed at a `RD 9` Check, or become `Frightened` of you for 6 Seconds.

Incredibly proud, stubborn and loyal creatures, described mostly as humanoid lions.
Pride upon pride, their mane is what defines their class, long and wavy manes always giving an advantage when arriving in any Keinfolk society.

#### Talach

**Talach talent** - Choose a form of art, you are a `Master` at creating it. Choose another, you are `Skilled` with it.

Tall, with pointed ears, humble and noble, truly a beloved race by most anyone who meets them.
Their curiosity and fantasy had made them into popular artists and poets, outside their cities often kept in castles and manors by nobility due to this affinity.
Their intelligence hasn't been perceived to be high nor their strength or speed, manual dexterity is the one thing they have and which no other race may rival them in.

#### Talkin

**Talkin Ear** - Your ears are very sensitive to whispers and murmurs.
When listening to someone in a crowded room, you hear as if the room was silent.

They are very similar to the Talach, however their ears are significantly flatter, lower, sometimes almost horizontal.
Quite sly, sneaky and adept at close range combat, they make excellent spies and thieves and are often employed as such.

#### Tylluan

**Tylluan Sight** - You have `NightVision`

The Tylluan are to owls what the keinfolk are to lions.

### Stats

You have 3 stats in the DawnStorm game, `Body`, `Soul` and `Influence`.
These represent everything you can do, and you should be able to categorize all actions under one of these stats.
Occassionally called points for ease of wording.

According to the strength of your character you start with a number of points
divided between your stats, 20 is suggested.

For the purpose of making these slightly more specific
in the case of `non-Professional` dice throws,
each `Body` stat you have or gain,
should be categorized under `Strength` or `Agility`.

|Stat|Examples|
|:---:|---|
|Body|strength, constitution|
|Soul|resisting magic and torture, casting magic, overcoming horrors and fears|
|Influence|persuasion, bartering with shopkeeps, underworld contacts|

When you are damaged or hurt, you will "lose" or "spend" these Stats,
but only temporarily, your maximum in the Stat always stays the same.
Consider it similair to losing Hit Points or Mana.
For example: damage in combat loses `Body`, verbal put-downs cost you `Influence`

**Regeneration** - Your stats regenerate after 8 hours of sleep, if you don't manage that amount, you regenerate only half of your total if you slept at least four hours, otherwise one quarter.

**Scarring** - When you are out of a given stat and some event forces you to spend it, you must `Scar` yourself, or you may `Scar` yourself voluntarily.
These symbolize damage beyond something you can walk-of after a day or two.
A scar should be accompanied with recieving an effect, or finding out about one.
A `Scar` is drawn across already spent points, and gives you `2 + 2 x Each spent point`.
This wound always has an explanation to what it is and should affect your character even when outside combat.
The taken up points of the Stat become unusable until you deal with the problem that is connected to the `Scar`.
A `Scar's Rank` is equal to the number of points it takes up.
If an effect would grant you additional Points in a Stat, you cannot Scar these, you may only Scar your own Stats.

|Stat + Scar Rank|Example Wound|
|:---:|---|
|Body Rank 1|Deeper cut|
|Body Rank 2|Major Food Poisoning|
|Body Rank 3|Stopped a sword with your Forearm|
|Body Rank 5|Missing Limb|
|Soul Rank 1|Small mental quirk|
|Soul Rank 5|Borderline madness|
|Influence Rank 1|Small public humiliation|
|Influence Rank 2|Nasty local rumours|
|Influence Rank 5|Denounced by ruler|

> Influence Scar's may often apply only based on location, similairly to Soul Scar's that may be temporarily triggered by something.

**Death and Unconsciousness** - Many Scars in any stat is enough to make a character unplayable, not having any more Unscarred Points in a Stat is taken as the character being dead, crazy or unable to interact with normal people.
After suffering Body Scars of a total equal to or more than a 3/4 of your Body stat, you fall unconscious.

**Expanding your skills** - Each time you spend `10XP` in professions, you can increase by one, any of your Stats.

### Professions

Professions give you bonuses to your rolls and special abilities you can use.
They don't necessarily mean that you are your Profession,
having a Rank in Thief doesn't necessarily translate into your character being a Thief,
it only shows that they have a similair set of skills,
that your character could've picked up and used elsewhere.
After performing an adventureous task with a profession, you are awarded `XP` by your GM.
The amount of `XP` you need to improve (`Rank Up`) a Profession is 4.

> You may want to raise these if you are planning on a very long term campaign

**Base Professions** - These professions are those that you don't need any prerequisites for.

Advanced professions will list many prerequisites, however they are usually significantly more powerful.
These prerequisites are usually in \[\] square brackets behind the Profession name.
A number followed by Professions, means that many `Ranks` divided among them, with at least 1 in each.
Some classes have other steps you must take to acquire them, these are listed under `Rite` in the description of the `Profession`.

**Skills** - The profession will list some things that it includes and thus gives bonuses for.
The Skills listed are just examples, each Profession includes much more than is listed
and the judgement of each individual action that comes up should be up to the Players and GM.

**Abilities** - Professions contain Abilities.
You gain one of these abilities every `Rank Up` in that skill.
When you see text in \[\] square brackets, those are prerequisites.
If the skill has an`Advanced (A)` next to it, you may only choose it after having invested at least 3 Ranks in said Profession.
If it has a `Master (M)`, choose it after
at least 12 Ranks in that and all related Professions.
Abilities with an `E - Epic` tag should mostly be used by the GM or allowed at the GMs discretion in very powerful campaigns.

**Specialities** - If a `Profession` lists `Specialities`,
you must choose one of them (or an original one if the GM allows) when `Ranking up`,
they perform as absolutely separate Professions.
If a Profession is related enough, you may use half of the die bonus.

## Inventory and Items

### Weapon Classes

Weapons apart from stated bonuses give you a free maneuver to use while wielding them and have an effect:

|Melee||
|:---:| :---:|
|Slashing|Accurate|
|Short Slashing|Feint|
|Blunt|Powerful|
|Piercing|Powerful|
|Short|You can instead attack twice, but not use a maneuver|
|Medium||
|Long|Short arms, cannot use maneuvers against you, except for feint|

> If nothing is stated, assume no maneuver bonus, medium weapon

**Load** - A character may only carry a reasonable number of minor items and up to their `Body` worth of major items.
Major items being, staffs, swords, rations,
guns, tents and the like. Every item carried above this amount gives you a `-2 Body` on skill checks.
If the item is made for a different size than you, it takes up `+2` for every size between you and the item.

**Makeshift** - Weapons you grab on the spot, without changing in any way, have a limit of 2 Stats of damage.
Optimizing them in some way (sharpening the stick), limits that to 3. In either case, you cannot use their free maneuvers. To nullify these limitations, you need to succeed at an appropriate skill check and input adequate amounts of time and effort.

### Money and Prices

#### Coins

|Coin|Worth|
|---|---|
|Copper Penny|6 in a commoner's day's work|
|Silver Shilling|100 Copper Pennies|
|Platinum|5000 Copper Pennies|
|Gold|10000 Copper Pennies|

|Food|Price|

|Day of Rations|1 Copper|

|Tools|Price|

## Spellcasting

Magic works through
magical symbols. Spell-casters can create these symbols in mid-air
instantaneously, however these persist only for a single round.
Long-term effects need an inscription on a surface to work.

**Mana** - Most effects will ask you to spend mana, you have a basic pool equal to
your `Soul`. At any time you may spend a `Soul` stat to
reset your mana back to that number (this does not let you spend more than your maximum mana on one spell).

### Spells

When casting a spell you declare,
a Motion and optionally an Element you know (collectively called words of power),
and what the desired outcome is.
Not all elements are useful with all motions.

If your character recieved damage in the last round, you get a cumulative `+2` to your roll + `1` for every `Stat` you lost, to a maximum of `+6`.
Having restrained hands adds a `+4` to the spell `RD`.

Having plenty of time to draw a magic circle Reduces the difficulty and cost of the spell, both by 1 per 10 minutes, but up to your die roll modifier for spellcasting.

#### Motions

Motions all have multiple Tiers with an `RD` and a `Mana` cost.
When casting a spell with the given motion's tier, you first deduct that much `Mana` from your pool, then roll against that `RD` to determine if the spell was successfull.

Failing the spell doesn't immediately mean nothing happened, your `degree of failure` determine that:

|Degree of failure|Effect|
|:---:|---|
|1-2|Slightly altered effect if possible, otherwise Failed spell|
|3-6|Failed Spell|
|7+|The spell backfires, GMs decision (usually not by inverting the effect)|

Tier Guidelines:

- **Tier I \[`RD10`, `1Mana`\]**: Achievable within the hour with sufficient skill and tools, the effect vanishes within 10 minutes
- **Tier II \[`RD6`, `6Mana`\]**: Apparently magical effects, mostly on inanimate objects or a small group of about 3 to 5, or advanced effects such as manipulation on one person
- **Tier III \[`RD0`, `XMana`\]**: Complex effects, extending to supernatural, manipulating reality with portals and short-range teleportation
- **Tier IV \[`RD-2`, `XMana + Soul Scar`\]**:
- **Tier V \[`RD-4`, `Soul Scar`\]**: Miracles

Motions:

- Cease
- Command
- Create
  - **Tier I**: Spontaneously create an item no bigger than the width of your hand, creatable from resources that you are touching.
  - **Tier II**: The item, must not exceed your outstretched arms length in any dimension.
- Destroy
- Divide/Dislocate
  - **Tier I**: Cut with your finger an inanimate object as if it were a knife.
  - **Tier IV**: Cut Metaphysical concepts
- Heal
  - **Tier I**: Close an actively bleeding wound and prevents it from getting infected.
- Join
  - **Tier I**: Connect two items that touch in any way and make them movable only by a living creature.
- Kill
  - **Tier I**: Cause Rot and Decay in a deceased animal or plant, making its body turn to dust within an hour.
- Scry
- Show
- Stride
- Summon
- Transmute

#### Elements

If the spell doesn't contain a corresponding Element for the effect,
you are limited to `Tier I` and `II` spells.
Some Elements will contain an `RD` modifier.

Elements:

- Body
- Cold / Ice
- Earth
- Fire / Heat
- Metal
- Mind
- Nature
- Necros (Necromantic)
- Spectra (Supernatural)
- Time
- Water

#### Characters

These both limit and flavour the spell's effects.

**Draconic** - The spell's effect is exhaled as a cone-shaped breath from the mouth

**Fey** - All effects are performed by nearby plants

**HexBlade** - The magic is limited only to the wearer himself and mainly his weapon and armour

**Artistic** - The effects must all be based on art, animate and move small objects, or create illusions

**Shadow** -

### Magic Glyphs

A magic glyph is created by inscribing a Motion and an Element, with a very specific intention into a solid surface and empowering them with `Mana`.
Mechanically, this requires you to succesfully cast the spell.
It takes `1 second` to drain `1 Mana` into a glyph.
At Dawn and Dusk, a glyph is sealed and cannot be expanded, only recharged.

Spending additional time and resources during casting, makes the casting cheaper and easier.
Reducing the cost by `1 Mana` and increasing the `DR` by 1,
costs `10 Silver` and `10 Minutes` times 3 to the power of the amount reduced.

When activated, the glyph casts the spell, draining from the enclosed mana pool.
If the item is one use, returning that mana to the creator's pool, otherwise it .
If the creature that activates a glyph is a magic user with a Character, the spell is cast with that character.
You may also designate a sound or simple occurence (such as someone stepping on it) that activates the glyph automatically.

> Since speech doesn't take up an action, this allows you to activate glyphs outside you turn.

**Soul Stone** -
You may substitute your own mana for a Soul Stone.

**Scrolls** -
Scrolls produce a one-time Spell effect, they don't require a `skill check` but still cost mana.
Afterwards, the papyrus disintegrates.
Creating one takes 10 minutes per Tier and
requires you to succesfully cast the spell per the Magic Glyph rules.

**Analyzing Magic** -
Perceiving a magic glyph, even an instantaneous one let's you identify any word of power that you know.
Identifying those you don't know, requires a knowledge (arcane) check and some time and concentration with the glyph or a page of notes you made about it.
Learning a word of power requires several days, of study and experimentation with notes from several glyphs,
with a `RD` of the number of different notes you're analyzing that have a word in them that you know.

**Enchanting Items** -
Items are Enchanted with tiny magic-glyphs that require about double time and complete concentration.
When a magic-glyph is on an item that can be entirely lifted by you single-handedly,
it can be activated while touching any point of the item.

**Countering Spells** -
You may `Dispel` a non-magic-glyph spell as a `Defence` maneuver or an `Action`.
Dispelling takes half the `Mana` of the spell and
a roll of `RD` of the spell `+3` or `+1` if you know the motion.

**God Invoking** -
Outside these boundaries lies Divine magic.
Monks and priests, worship and directly invoke a magical being.
Others must use complex rituals to win their interest.
Divine magic cannot be understood by non-divine casters at all.

## Combat

### Attacks

To determine the outcome of an attack, roll the attack as a skill check,
afterwards, if the defending party succeeds at a skill check with a `RD` of your attack roll,
they succesfully prevented your attack from landing.

When you are hit you lose Stats, 1 by default,
and an additional one for every time the degrees of success
of the attack exceed your non-Professional dire bonus.
If your Degree of Success is more than your enemy's skill,
you score a critical success and the enemy loses 1 additional stat for every degree of success beyond that skill.

1 Round of combat is 5 seconds.
If an effect would end X seconds into the round, it ends X turns into the round,
or if the encounter has less than 4 participants, it ends immediately after your turn.

### Initiative

Combat is initiated by an attack, that creature is first in initiative and has used up its turn delivering this attack.

After which, others go in the following order:

|#|Action|
|:---:|---|
|1|Unarmed|
|2|Short Weapons|
|3|Medium Weapons|
|4|Magic|
|5|Other Actions|
|6|Long Weapons|

The rest is up to the GM or chance.

If one party had been ambushed, every member of the other is automatically `Stumbled`.
If one is not attacked in a round, he rises up in the Initiative by one creature.

### Maneuvers

To use a `Basic` maneuver, you spend 1 Stat.
One `Defence/Parry` per turn is free if you have a free weapon or shield with which you didn't attack.
You cannot use more than 1 maneuver per turn (including free maneuvers) and a Defence/Parry or Feint, unless a separate effect states so.

**A - Precise** - Roll 5D6 take lowest 3

**Accurate** - Roll 4d6 take lowest 3

**A - Mighty** - Causes target to lose `1/2` more from a Stat (round down; minimum 2)

**Powerful** - Causes target to lose `1/3` more from a Stat (round down; minimum 1)

**Weak** - Causes target to lose half as much of a Stat

**Feint** - You give an ally a free Basic Maneuver against the same enemy or Kick the creature back attempting to make him stumbled or moving them

**Defence/Armor/Parry/Dodge** - You roll against the enemy's attack roll + your rank in this,
if you succeed the hit is absorbed or parried and is counted as a miss,
doesn't work against magical effects by default except Dodge

> A - indicates that said maneuver is `Advanced` which may be referenced by other rules. Others are called `Basic`

### Turn Actions

In a turn, you have two phases, a move and a move/action phase.
Your move allows you to move 1 + A quarter of you Speed Skill in meters.

As an action you may do one of the following:

- Attack
- Defend - Gain `Dodge 0` until the start of your next turn, but move a pace backwards or sideways when attacked
- Activate a Magic Circle
- Aid - You may roll a skill check against `RD 10`, if you succeed, an ally attempting the same check acts as if they are `Skilled`, if both of you are skilled, you may roll against `RD 12` , in which case the ally rolls as a `Master`
- Ready - Spend the round changing held items, if they're in a bag, you should spend 2 actions taking them out. Similair to clothing, putting on chainmail would cost a turn, a full suit would cost 2 to 3.
- Perform Action - Such as, put out fire or pull lever

## Environment

**Fall** - 1 Body per 5 m

**Suffocation** - 1 + your Constitution `Die Bonus` in minutes, then `Out of Breath` for half a minute,
then you are `Exhausted` for 18 seconds,
after which you start recieving a growing scar which grows by one for every 3 seconds.
If you are attacked and have to defend in a physically demanding way (dodging counts, armor does not), you lose 9 seconds of air.

**Food and Water** - not eating or drinking a day gives you -1 to body based rolls, not recieving sustenance for 3 days, gives you `Exhaustion`, which increases by 1 level for every day after that.

**Sleep** - not sleeping works the same as food and water, but starts giving you debuffs after 2 days of no sleep

**Light** - -2 to sight based activities in dim light, -3 in near dark

**Elemental Damage** - You lose 1 body per round of exposure per strength of element

## Size

|Size|Description|
|---|---|
|Scrawny|Think flies or insects|
|Tiny|Smaller than 0.3m in all dimensions|
|Small|Smaller than 1m in all dimensions|
|Normal|Humans|
|Large|From 2m|
|Huge|Bigger than about 5m|
|Giant|Dragons|
|Colossal|Leviathans, Ancient Dragons|
|Immense|Towering over land itself|
|Primal|Deities & Titans|

If a creature exceeds another's size, it can freely use the `Powerful` maneuver with Body based encounters against that creature,
however the target acts as if it was `Skilled` at `Dodging` them.
Normal has an average of `5 Body`,
going lower subtracts 1,
bigger sizes are double of the previous size.

> **Weight** - If for any reason you need an estimate of weight for your humanoid players. Use \[Weight = 20x(Height^2)\] with kg and m. Adjusting the 20 about 3 up (more weight) or down (underweight).

## Keywords

**Area** - This shows that an action performed affects a certain area such as an explosion or cannonball. Normally this is specified as a simple length that specifies the diameter of a sphere or length of a line based on context. By default a sphere centered on you.

**RD** - The difficulty of a roll

**Degrees of success** - The number by which you exceed the required `RD`

**Range** - Range may specify an I before the distance to indicate an incorporeal effect that passes unhindered through solid objects.

**Regeneration** - The creature regains X Body at the start of its turn.

**Natural Armor/Mindlock/Beloved** - Expending the `Body/Soul/Influence` resource is always reduced by said amount. May specify a source in parentheses that nullifies this protection.

**Fly** - Describes Fly Speed

**Sense** - Always knows about all movement within a certain radius. It can feel generally what kind of creature it is.

**Skilled** - You subtract 1 from your roll, stackable

**Master** - You subtract 2 from your roll

**Nightvision** - Does not suffer from lack of proper lighting.

**Recharge** - You roll a D6 and if it's less than X the ability is ready to use again.

**Immunity** - The stated source cannot cause the creature to expend Stats.

**Resistance** - Halve the number of Stats lost due to an effect caused by this source.

**Vulnerability** - Double the number of Stats lost due to an effect caused by this source.

**Stumped/Distracted** - You can't use any maneuvers, that you choose to use (that means maneuvers that you spend Stats for or effects that state you *may* use them)

### Conditions

**Stumbled** - creatures go at the end of initiative (in the order they were stumbled, if there is more than one) and cannot move more than 1 step, if they are already at the end 9f initiative, they move to the beginning of initiative but lose their next turn

**Short of Breath** - While you are short of breath, you can't use any `Maneuvers` with your actions that use the `Body` skill and no *Advanced Maneuvers* with actions using the `Soul` skill. If you fail an action you become *Exhausted* for the rest of the duration + *1 Round* or just *1 Round* if the `Out of Breath`'s duration is longer than a minute or 1 minute if over 1 hour.

**Exhausted** - You suffer a `-2` on all rolls per level of Exhaustion as well as all the hindrances given by `Short of Breath`.

**Restrained** -

## Enemies

For ease of play, enemies do not track most of their stats as closely as players do.
They will usually just state `Body`, `Soul` and `Influence`; or a universal resource called `Fate` if the enemy is fodder enough.
They may state several abilities with cooldowns and attacks with their own die bonuses.
If it is stated that a weapon either carried or natural, is of a certain type, consider the enemy to be able to use the maneuvers that those weapons would grant.
