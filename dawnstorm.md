# DawnStorm - A 3D6 Pen & Paper RPG

{::options auto_ids="true" /}

- TOC_TEST
{:toc}

## Preword

I started this project with the intention of ending up with a simple RPG system,
that nonetheless felt good and was fast to play.
The second goal was to give as much freedom as possible, while keeping it simple for both the players and the GM.

When you see something colored like `THIS` it is a keyword and will be explained somewhere later on.

Some parts are labelled like
> THIS
These provide some additional suggestions, explanations or just general commentary.

When dividing or multiplying, Always round **against** your favor.

The last thing is that almost all of this is built as suggestions,
I'm more than happy if the players ask politely for items not on lists,
spell words not shown and races not recommended,
that is one of the points to the game.

Now, let's get rolling.

## Skill Checks

When you need to check if you succeeded at a particular task,
you roll 3D6 and if you Rolled **higher** or equal to the `Roll Difficulty` (further called `RD`) you were successfull.
Many effects will subtract or add to your roll, most commonly your Professions.
You may add, up to two Profession's bonuses from your roll.

|RD||
|:---:|---|
|8|Easy|
|11|Normal|
|13||
|15|Hard|

**Group checks** - If you need to use a skill against a crowd,
roll 4 times for the crowd,
the whole crowd is divided on the subject based on the success rate of the rolls.

## Character creation

### Race

The [Bestiary](/bestiary/) contains some suggestions for this.

### Stats

You have 3 stats in the DawnStorm game, `Body`, `Soul` and `Influence`.
These represent everything you can do, and you should be able to categorize all actions under one of these stats.
Occassionally called points for ease of wording.

According to the power of your character you start with a number of points
divided between your stats,
15 to 20 is suggested.

|Stat|Examples|
|:---:|---|
|Body|strength, constitution|
|Soul|overcoming horrors and fears, resisting magic and torture, casting magic|
|Influence|persuasion, bartering with shopkeeps, underworld contacts|

When you are damaged or hurt, you will "lose" these Stats,
but only temporarily, your maximum in the Stat always stays the same.
Consider it similar to losing Hit Points or Mana.
For example: damage in combat loses `Body`, verbal put-downs cost you `Influence`

**Regeneration** - You regenerate 4 stats after 8 hours of sleep, if you sleep at least 4 hours, you regain 2.
Taking other types of long rests can gain you back 1 stat and
wounds can be considered tended to.

    Easy Mode - Your stats regenerate after 8 hours of sleep, if you don't manage that amount, you regenerate only half of your total if you slept at least four hours, otherwise one quarter.

**Scarring** - When you are out of a given stat and some event forces you to lose it, you must `Scar` yourself, in other situations you may `Scar` yourself voluntarily.
These symbolize damage beyond something you can walk-of after a day or two.
A scar should be accompanied with recieving an effect, or finding out about one (such as poison).
A `Scar` is drawn across already spent points, and gives you `2 + 2 x Each spent point`.
This wound always has an explanation to what it is and should affect your character even when outside combat.
The taken up points of the Stat become unusable until you deal with the problem that is connected to the `Scar`.
A `Scar's Rank` is equal to the number of points it makes unusable.
If an effect would grant you additional Points in a Stat, you cannot Scar these, you may only Scar your own Stats.

|Stat + Scar Rank|Example Wound|
|:---:|---|
|Body Rank 1|Deeper cut|
|Body Rank 2|Major Food Poisoning|
|Body Rank 3|Stopped a sword with your Forearm|
|Body Rank 5|Missing Limb|
|Soul Rank 1|Small mental quirk|
|Soul Rank 5|Borderline madness|
|Influence Rank 1|Small public humiliation|
|Influence Rank 2|Nasty local rumours|
|Influence Rank 5|Denounced by ruler|

> Influence Scar's may often apply only based on location, similairly to Soul Scar's that may be temporarily triggered by something.

**Death and Unconsciousness** - Many Scars in any stat is enough to make a character unplayable, not having any more Unscarred Points in a Stat is taken as the character being dead, crazy or unable to interact with normal people.
After suffering Body Scars of a total equal to or higher than 3/4 of your Body stat, you fall unconscious.

**Expanding your skills** - Each time you spend `8XP` in professions, you can increase by one, any of your Stats.

**non-Professional checks** - If you need to check your success in an action,
that doesn't apply to any of your professions,
you may roll with a bonus of your stat divided by 3 rounded down - 1.
For the purpose of making these slightly more specific,
each `Body` stat you have or gain,
should be categorized under `Strength` or `Agility`.

### Professions

Professions give you bonuses to your rolls and special abilities you can use.
They don't necessarily mean that you are your Profession,
having a Rank in Thief doesn't necessarily translate into your character being a Thief,
it only shows that they have a similar set of skills,
that your character could've picked up and used elsewhere.
After performing an adventureous task, you are awarded `XP` by your GM.
The amount of `XP` you need to improve (`Rank Up`) a Profession is `4XP`.
And every `Rank Up` grants you a `+1` Die roll bonus.

Professions are divided into a couple Tiers, usually 3.
`Tier I` is learning and becoming the professions some sort of apprentice or student,
`Tier II` is the actual profession and
`Tier III` is a sort of veteran status.

> University Student -> Engineer -> Senior Engineer

After taking 3 levels in a profession you may start Ranking up its next Tier,
alternatively 1.5x the required amount in any related Professions,
this is always the case with professions that do not have a first Tier.

> So having 3 Ranks in Magic Acolyte (Tier I) and 1 rank in Hunter (Tier I) would allow you to take Druid (Tier II)

Some professions will list prerequisites.
These prerequisites are listed under `Rite` in the description of the `Profession`.

**Skills** - The profession will list some things that it includes and thus gives bonuses for.
The Skills listed are examples, each Profession includes more than is listed
and the judgement of each individual action that comes up should be up to the Players and the GM
(if a specific ability adds something as a skill, it isn't considered as a skill by default).
If an `Ability` states that you now have a skill in something,
act as if the profession lists it in its skills.

**Abilities** - Professions contain Abilities.
You gain one of these abilities every `Rank Up` in that skill.
When you see text in \[\] square brackets, those are prerequisites.

**Specialties** - If a `Profession` lists `Specialties`,
you must choose one of them (or make up your own if the GM allows) when `Ranking up`,
they perform as absolutely separate Professions.
If it is related enough, but not quite your speciality, you may use half of the die bonus.

> These are most often Knowledge based, where you choose one domain to be learned in.

As DawnStorm is not setting specific, I do not provide any in this document, there should be some example ones in the modules.
Otherwise, Skills, should be self explanatory when you create your own professions.
And abilities should be something that someone talented may pick-up after performing that Profession for about a year's time,
I.E. A chef weighing ingredients perfectly in hand, a librarian remembering a long book index, or an archer shooting multiple arrows if they perhaps did that for fun.

## Inventory and Items

### Weapon Classes

Weapons apart from stated bonuses have a type and length (i.e. long piercing).
When describing an animal's attacks, the same rules can be used.
These give you a free maneuver to use while wielding them and have an effect:

|Basic Weapon Classes||
|:---:|:---:|
|Slashing|Accurate|
|Short Slashing|Feint|
|Blunt|Powerful|
|Piercing|Powerful|
|Short|You can instead attack twice with a `-2` penalty, but not use a maneuver|
|Long|Short arms, cannot use maneuvers against you, except for feint|
|Shield|Grants two `Defence` maneuvers|

> If nothing is stated, assume no maneuver bonus, medium weapon

**Load** - A character may only comfortably carry a reasonable number of minor items and up to their `Body` worth of major items.
Major items being, staffs, swords, rations,
guns, tents and the like.
Every item carried above this amount gives you a `-2 Body` on skill checks.
If the item is made for a different size than you, it takes up 1 more or less for every size between you and the item.

**Makeshift** - Weapons you grab on the spot, without changing in any way, have a limit of 2 Stats of damage.
Optimizing them in some way (sharpening the stick), limits that to 3.
In either case, you cannot use their free maneuvers.
To nullify these limitations, you need to succeed at an appropriate skill check and input adequate amounts of time and effort. See [Creating Items](#Item-Creation).

### Item Creation

When determining the difficulty of lingering effects (such as traps or camouflage) created by players,
let them roll upon creation and then use that as the `DR`.
The GM may raise or lower the `DR` of checks by around 3,
if there are advantages or disadvantages such as tools, time or bad lighting.

## Combat

### Attacks

To determine the outcome of an attack, roll the attack as a skill check.
Afterwards, the defending party has multiple ways to prevent the damage,
most commonly by using the `Defence` maneuver.

When an attack is made, you will lose stats,
the amount is how many times the difference between your rolls,
exceeds your `Die Bonus`.

**Pain** -
Recieving damage, gives you a `-3` to all offensive rolls and `-2` on others,
until the end of your next turn or next round, whichever comes first.

### Initiative

Combat is initiated by an attack, that creature is first in initiative and has used up its turn delivering this attack.

After which, others go in the following order:

|#|Action|
|:---:|---|
|1|Unarmed|
|2|Short Weapons|
|3|Medium Weapons|
|4|Magic|
|5|Other Actions|
|6|Long Weapons|

After these are exhausted, 1 Round had passed.
Each of these actions take 1 second.

> Basically, every round, the GM goes through, asking:
> Any Unarmed?, Any Magic?, etc.
> This means that you may change your decisions based on what previous actions were taken

The rest is up to the GM or random chance.

If one party had been ambushed, every member of the other is automatically `Stumbled`.
If you wish to save your action for later, that is possible,
for clarity, these should be announced anyway and go before all others, once they are used.
Only one saved action can be held, it is lost upon your next turn.

### Zones

To aid with larger battlefields and positioning, DawnStorm uses Zones.
For Example, you may have a chapel, where the fight is divided between
the two wings, the main hall, the altar, etc.
Based on the number of enemies and the type of attacks there are,
you may use as few or many as is practical.
For flying creatures, identical zones exist above the ground ones,
where only the flying creatures can go.
Unless stated otherwise you may attack anyone in your zone.

### Maneuvers

To use a `Basic` maneuver, you spend 1 Stat,
though only if an effect allows you to use it.
`Advanced` maneuvers, marked `A`, cost 2 Stats.

One `Defence/Parry` per turn is free per weapon or shield with which you didn't attack.

**A - Precise** - Roll 5D6 take lowest 3

**Accurate** - Roll 4d6 take lowest 3

**A - Mighty** - Causes target to lose double from a Stat (round down; minimum 2)

**Powerful** - Causes target to lose `1/2` more from a Stat (round down; minimum 1)

**Weak** - Causes target to lose half as much of a Stat

**Feint** - You give an ally a free Basic Maneuver against the same enemy or Kick the creature back attempting to make them stumbled or moving them; Under 1m and not stumbled if the degree of success is lower than 2

**Defence/Armor/Parry/Dodge** - You roll against the enemy's attack roll + your rank in this,
if you succeed, the hit is absorbed or parried and is counted as a miss,
doesn't work against magical effects by default, except Dodge

### Turn Actions

In a turn, you have two phases, a move and a move/action phase.
Your move allows you to move by 1 zone.

As an action you may do one of the following:

- Attack
- Defend - Gain or grant an ally in the same zone `Dodge 0` until the start of your next turn
- Activate a Magic Glyph
- Aid - You may roll a skill check against `RD 10`, if you succeed, an ally attempting the same check acts as if they are `Skilled`, if both of you are skilled, you may roll against `RD 8` , in which case the ally rolls as a `Master`
- Ready - Spend the round changing held items, if they're in a bag, you should spend 2 actions taking them out. Similair to clothing, putting on chainmail would cost a turn, a full suit would cost 2 to 3.
- Perform Action - Such as, put out fire or pull lever

## Environmental Effects

**Fall** - 1 Body per 5 m

**Suffocation** - 1 + your Constitution `Die Bonus` in minutes, then `Out of Breath` for half a minute,
then you are `Exhausted` for 18 seconds,
after which you start recieving a growing scar which grows by one for every 3 seconds.
If you are attacked and have to defend in a physically demanding way (dodging counts, armor does not), you lose 9 seconds of air.

**Food and Water** - not eating or drinking a day gives you -1 to body based rolls, not recieving sustenance for 3 days, gives you `Exhaustion`, which increases by 1 level for every day after that.

**Sleep** - not sleeping works the same as food and water, but starts giving you debuffs after 2 days of no sleep

**Light** - -2 to sight based activities in dim light, -3 in near dark

**Elemental Damage** - You lose 1 body per round of exposure per strength of element, regular fire causes 1 Body of damage every 2 rounds

## Size

|Size|Description|
|---|---|
|Scrawny|Think flies or insects|
|Tiny|Smaller than 0.3m in all dimensions|
|Small|Smaller than 1m in all dimensions|
|Normal|Humans|
|Large|From 2m|
|Huge|Bigger than about 5m|
|Giant|Dragons|
|Colossal|Leviathans, Ancient Dragons|
|Immense|Towering over land itself|
|Primal|Deities & Titans|

If a creature exceeds another's size, it can freely use the `Powerful` maneuver with Body based encounters against that creature,
however the target acts as if it was `Skilled` at `Dodging` them.
Normal has an average of `5 Body`,
going lower subtracts 1,
bigger sizes are double of the previous size.

> **Weight** - If for any reason you need an estimate of weight for your humanoid players. Use \[Weight = 20x(Height^2)\] with kg and m. Adjusting the 20 about 3 up (more weight) or down (underweight).

## Keywords

**Area** - This shows that an action performed affects a certain area such as an explosion or cannonball. Normally this is specified as a simple length that specifies the diameter of a sphere or length of a line based on context. By default a sphere centered on you.

**RD** - The difficulty of a roll

**Degrees of success** - The number by which you exceed the required `RD`

**Range** - Range may specify an I before the distance to indicate an incorporeal effect that passes unhindered through solid objects.

**Regeneration** - The creature regains X Body at the start of its turn.

**Natural Armor/Mindlock/Beloved** - Expending the `Body/Soul/Influence` resource is always reduced by said amount. May specify a source in parentheses that nullifies this protection.

**Fly** - Describes Fly Speed

**Sense** - Always knows about all movement within a certain radius. It can feel generally what kind of creature it is.

**Skilled** - Your allowed Base maneuvers are free

**Master** - You may use `Advanced` maneuvers, if you are a `Master` you are also `Skilled`

**Nightvision** - Does not suffer from lack of proper lighting.

**Recharge** - You roll a D6 and if it's less than X the ability is ready to use again.

**Immunity** - The stated source cannot cause the creature to expend Stats.

**Resistance** - Halve the number of Stats lost due to an effect caused by this source.

**Vulnerability** - Double the number of Stats lost due to an effect caused by this source.

**Stumped/Distracted** - You can't use any maneuvers, that you choose to use (that means maneuvers that you spend Stats for or effects that state you *may* use them)

### Conditions

**Stumbled** - you go at the end of initiative (in the order they were stumbled, if there is more than one) and cannot move more than 1 step, if you are already stumbled, you lose your next turn.
This condition ends on you turn.

**Short of Breath** - While you are short of breath, you can't use any `Maneuvers` with your actions that use the `Body` skill, no speech-based actions and no *Advanced Maneuvers* with actions using the `Soul` skill. If you fail an action you become *Exhausted* for the rest of the duration + *1 Round* or just *1 Round* if the `Out of Breath`'s duration is longer than an hour.

**Exhausted** - You suffer a `-2` on all rolls per level of Exhaustion as well as all the hindrances given by `Short of Breath`.

**Restrained** -

## Enemies

For ease of play, enemies do not track most of their stats as closely as players do.
They will usually just state `Body`, `Soul` and `Influence`; or a universal resource called `Fate` if the enemy is fodder enough.
They may state several abilities with cooldowns and attacks with their own die bonuses.
If it is stated that a weapon either carried or natural, is of a certain type, consider the enemy to be able to use the maneuvers that those weapons would grant.

Legendary creatures,
that are fought mostly 1 against the entire party,
should use Legendary actions.
This allows the creature to take an action after every other creature,
as long as it has additional logical ways to do this.
I.E.: Claws, a tail and a fiery breath
