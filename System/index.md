### Attributes

#### Stats

You have 3 basic stats, they are connected to the 3 Base skills (Body,
Soul, Influence). You have an amount of so called resources equal to 3 +
You Rank in that skill.e

#### Size

If a creature exceeds another's size by one, it can freely use the
*Powerful* maneuver with Body based encounters against that creature.
Exceeding its size by more than that allows instead to utilize the
*Mighty* maneuver and adds 8 to the roll for every size by which it is
exceeded.

| Size     | Description                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Scrawny  | Think flies, insects and pixies    |
| Tiny     | Smaller than 30m in all dimensions |
| Small    | Smaller than 1m in all dimensions  |
| Normal   | Humans                             |
| Huge     | Bigger than about 2.5m             |
| Giant    | Small dragons                      |
| Colossal |                                    |
| Immense  | Towering over land itself          |
| Primal   | Deities & Titans                   |

#### Basic Skills

Unspecified = *Medium*
The GM gives you a *Skill Rank Up* when you use a skill to some new
extent. The amount of *Rank Ups* you need to improve any skill is based
on it's difficulty:

|   Cost | Name|
|:------: |-----------|
|   1    |*Trivial*|
|  2    |*Easy*|
| 3   | *Medium*|
|    5  |  *Hard*|
|   6 |   *Master*|
|  8|    *Base*|

When you Rank Up in a non-Base skill you may spend the amount of *Rank
Ups* it took and spend a third of them (at least one, rounded down) them
in any Skill that is a descendant of the Ranked Up skill, however it may
not exceed the level of it's parent by more than 1. To find your Die
Bonus to a certain action, find a skill that most closely resembles that
action, and then add to it its Base Skill.

**Base Skills** - Everything starts with these skills, they are all *Base*difficulty.
These are Body, Soul and Influence.

**Abilities** - Some skills may contain Abilities. You gain one of these abilities every
Rank up in that skill, beyond the third. If the skill has an A
(Advanced) next to it, you may only choose it after having invested at
least 5 levels in said skill. If it has an M (Master), choose it after
at least 10 levels. Abilities with an E are called Epic abilities and
should mostly be used by the GM or allowed at the GMs discretion in very
powerful campaigns, a beginning level of 15 is recommended.

For other spell suggestions and costs, check the [Grimoire](../Grimoire).

**Mana** - Most effects will ask you to spend mana, you have a basic pool equal to
your *Soul Resources*. At any time you may spend a Soul resource to
increase your current mana by your *Soul Rank*. Magic works through
magical symbols. Spell-casters can create these circles in the air
instantaneously, however these persist only for a single round.

## Combat

    Thoughts:
    Danger based on successes\
    Initiative based on successes, initiative pushback\
    Roll at end of encounter to quickly start\
    Base resource of 2\
    If a party is surprised they become stumbled\
    Obvious advantage gives you two maneuvers instead of one\
    If an attack roll exceeds your remaining resources, you have to spend an
    additional resource. Two, if over double your remaining resources of
    said type.\
    10 Second round

### Attacks

Two Characters actively involved in combat and interacting with their
weapons roll-off. The Attack and Defence action's are the same as any
other action, consider them skill checks adding appropriate Die Bonuses.
I.E. Dodging an attack would require a Dexterity check, Blocking it with
a shield would depend on whether you are deflecting or absorbing the
force, resulting in your Dexterity or Body Bonuses to be added
respectively, if you think of any more specific skills for you to use
and gain extra Bonuses, go for it, get creative.

############ Spending Resources and Scarring

When you are hit you must spend an amount of points from the appropriate
Stat, no exceptions, if you have no more points to spend regularly you
must scar yourself. You may spend already spent points in bulk for 2 +
Double their worth, however you suffer a permanent wound. This is called
*Scarring*. A Scar's *Rank* is how many points it spent. Scars may have
many forms and the point of one big scar is to put into mechanics the
fact that it is one big injury.

########## Examples of Scars

############ Body

|Rank | Description |
|:--------:| -------------------|
|   Rank 1  |Hurting Bruise|
|  Rank 2 | Deep bleeding cut|
| Rank 4|  Missing limb|

############ Soul

|Rank | Description |
|:--------:| -------------------|
|  Rank 1 | Slight Quirk|
|   Rank 5  |Borderline Insanity|

############ Influence

|Rank | Description |
|:--------:| -------------------|
|Rank 2 | Funny memory people tease you for|
| Rank 5  |Deeply rooted shame|

A scar disappears once its cause has been resolved and you don't
regenerate those points until that happens. Receiving a wound out of
Battle also results in such a Scar.
