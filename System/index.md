## Character creation

### Size

If a creature exceeds another's size by one, it can freely use the `Powerful` maneuver with Body based encounters against that creature.
Exceeding its size by more than that allows instead to utilize the `Mighty` maneuver and adds 8 to the roll for every size by which it is exceeded.

| Size     | Description                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Scrawny  | Think flies or insects             |
| Tiny     | Smaller than 0.3m in all dimensions|
| Small    | Smaller than 1m in all dimensions  |
| Normal   | Humans                             |
|Large|From 2m|
| Huge     | Bigger than about 5m             |
| Giant    | Dragons                            |
| Colossal | Leviathans, Ancient Dragons        |
| Immense  | Towering over land itself          |
| Primal   | Deities & Titans                   |

### Skills

The GM gives you a `Skill Point` when you use a skill in a non-trivial way, they should target about 3 `SP` an hour.

> `Skill Point` worthy case example:

You have an amount of so called `Resources` equal to 3 + Your Rank in that skill.

The amount of `Rank Ups` you need to improve any skill is based on it's difficulty:

|   Cost | Name|
|:------: |-----------|
|   1    |*Trivial*|
|  2    |*Easy*|
| 3   | *Medium*|
|    5  |  *Hard*|
|   6 |   *Master*|
|  8|    *Base*|

> If nothing is listed assume *Medium*

When you `Rank Up` in a non-Base skill you may spend the amount of `Skill Points` it took and spend half of them (at least one, rounded down) them in any Skill that is a descendant of the Ranked Up skill, however it may not exceed the level of it's parent by more than 1.
To find your `Die Bonus` to a certain action, find a skill that most closely resembles that action, and then add to it its Base Skill.

Bonuses and Hindrances to a skill will be specified in the format `-3 Soul`, which would mean that anytime you want to use the `Soul` skill for a check, consider it to be 3 lower than it actually is. If this would drop your level so that you couldnt've taken a skill, you lose access to that skill.

> If I have a skill of level 6 with 2 selected Basic abilities, I would lose no abilities at `-1 Skill`, 1 ability at `-2 Skill`, because there is not enough levels in the skill to reach my current set of abilities.

**Base Skills** - Everything starts with these skills, they are all `Base` difficulty.
These are `Body`, `Soul` and `Influence`.

**Abilities** - Some skills may contain Abilities. You gain one of these abilities every
Rank up in that skill, beyond the third. If the skill has an `A
(Advanced)` next to it, you may only choose it after having invested at
least 5 levels in said skill. If it has an `M (Master)`, choose it after
at least 10 levels. Abilities with an `E - Epic` tag
should mostly be used by the GM or allowed at the GMs discretion in very
powerful campaigns, a beginning level of 15 is recommended. `D - Deity`, only DMs should use it very carefully and after thorough consideration.

## Skill Checks

### Spending Resources and Scarring

When you are hit you must spend an amount of points from the appropriate Skill, no exceptions, if you have no more `resources` to spend you must scar yourself.

**Scarring** - You may spend already spent points in bulk for 2 +
Double their worth, however you suffer a permanent wound.
A Scar's `Rank` is how many points it spent.
Scars may have many forms and the point of one big scar is to put into mechanics the fact that it is one big injury.

## Inventory and Items

**Makeshift** -

### Weapon Classes

Weapons apart from stated bonuses give you a free maneuver to use while wielding them.

|        Melee||
|:-------------------:| :-----:|
|  Slashing       | Accurate|
|Short Slashing|Feint|
|     Blunt       |  Powerful|
|    Piercing        |Powerful|
|Shield|Defence|

**Load** - A character may only carry a reasonable number of minor items and up to their `Body` worth of major items.
Major items being, staffs, swords,
guns, tents and the like. Every item carried above this amount gives you a `-2 Body` on skill checks.

> If you can't place your spell, ask your GM, perhaps write down what you learned and make a spellbook.
> For other spell suggestions and costs, check the [Grimoire](../Grimoire).

**Mana** - Most effects will ask you to spend mana, you have a basic pool equal to
your `Soul Resources`. At any time you may spend a Soul resource to
increase your current mana by your `Soul Rank`. Magic works through
magical symbols. Spell-casters can create these circles in the air
instantaneously, however these persist only for a single round.

## Combat

    Thoughts:
    Danger based on successes
    Initiative based on successes, initiative pushback
    Roll at end of encounter to quickly start
    Base resource of 2
    If a party is surprised they become stumbled
    Obvious advantage gives you two maneuvers instead of one
    If an attack roll exceeds your remaining resources, you have to spend an
    additional resource. Two, if over double your remaining resources of
    said type.
    10 Second round

### Attacks

Two Characters actively involved in combat and interacting with their
weapons roll-off. The Attack and Defence action's are the same as any
other action, consider them skill checks adding appropriate Die Bonuses.
I.E. Dodging an attack would require a `Dexterity` check, Blocking it with a shield would depend on whether you are deflecting or absorbing the force, resulting in your `Dexterity` or `Body` Bonuses to be added respectively,
if you think of any more specific skills for you to use and gain extra Bonuses, go for it, get creative.

When you are hit you lose Resources, 1 by default, however many effects alter this.

#### Examples of Scars

|Body Scar | Description |
|:--------:| -------------------|
|   Rank 1  |Hurting Bruise|
|  Rank 2 | Deep bleeding cut|
| Rank 4|  Missing limb|

|Soul Scar | Description |
|:--------:| -------------------|
|  Rank 1 | Slight Quirk|
|   Rank 5  |Borderline Insanity|

|Influence Scar | Description |
|:--------:| -------------------|
|Rank 2 | Funny memory people tease you for|
| Rank 5  |Deeply rooted shame|

A scar disappears once its cause has been resolved and you don't
regenerate those points until that happens. Receiving a wound out of
Battle also results in such a Scar.
