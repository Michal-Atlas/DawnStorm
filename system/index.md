## Character creation

### Size

If a creature exceeds another's size by one, it can freely use the `Powerful` maneuver with Body based encounters against that creature.
Exceeding its size by more than that allows instead to utilize the `Mighty` maneuver and subtract 8 from the roll for every size by which it is exceeded.
For every size beyond the first, add 4 to Body based rolls.

|Size|Description|
|---|---|
|Scrawny|Think flies or insects|
|Tiny     | Smaller than 0.3m in all dimensions|
|Small    | Smaller than 1m in all dimensions  |
|Normal   | Humans                             |
|Large|From 2m|
|Huge     | Bigger than about 5m             |
|Giant    | Dragons                            |
|Colossal | Leviathans, Ancient Dragons        |
|Immense  | Towering over land itself          |
|Primal   | Deities & Titans                   |

> **Weight** - If for any reason you need an estimate of weight for your humanoid players. Use \[Weight = 20x(Height^2)\] with kg and m. Adjusting the 20 about 3 up (more weight) or down (underweight).

### Skills

The GM gives you a `Skill Point` when you use a skill in a non-trivial way.

> `Skill Point` worthy case example:

The amount of `Skill Points` you need to improve any skill is based on it's difficulty and then add +1 per Rank up to 4:

|Cost|Name|
|:---:|---|
|2|*Trivial*|
|3|*Easy*|
|4|*Medium*|
|5|*Hard*|
|6|*Master*|
|7|*Base*|

> If nothing is listed assume *Medium*

When you `Rank Up` in a skill you may spend the amount of `Skill Points` it took and spend half of them (at least one, rounded down) them in any Skill that is a descendant of the Ranked Up skill, however it may not exceed the level of it's parent by more than 2.

Bonuses and Hindrances to a skill will be specified in the format `-3 Soul`, which would mean that anytime you want to use the `Soul` skill for a check, consider it to be 3 lower than it actually is. If this would drop your level so that you couldnt've taken a skill, you lose access to that skill.

> If I have a skill of level 6 with 2 selected Basic abilities, I would lose no abilities at `-1 Skill`, 1 ability at `-2 Skill`, because there is not enough levels in the skill to reach my current set of abilities.

**Base Skills** - Everything starts with these skills, they are all `Base` difficulty.
These are `Body`, `Soul` and `Influence`.

**Abilities** - Some skills contain Abilities. You gain one of these abilities every
`Die Bonus` Increase in that skill, beyond the third Rank. If the skill has an `A
(Advanced)` next to it, you may only choose it after having invested at
least 7 Ranks in said skill. If it has an `M (Master)`, choose it after
at least 12 Ranks. Abilities with an `E - Epic` tag
should mostly be used by the GM or allowed at the GMs discretion in very
powerful campaigns, a beginning Rank of 18 is recommended. `D - Deity`, only DMs should use it very carefully and after thorough consideration.

**Specialities** - If a skill lists Specialities, you must choose one of them (or a new one if the GM allows) when `Ranking up`, they perform as absolutely separate skills.
If a subject is related enough, you may use half of the die bonus.

**Class** - You start with a set of skills according to your class

**Race** - If your race includes some modifiers add them on top off a class. If there is a flat number without a plus or minus, it is the maximum you should start with.

#### [Classes](classes)

#### [List of Basic Skills](skills)

## Stats

You have 3 stats in the DawnStorm game, `Body`, `Soul` and `Influence`.
These represent everything you can do, and you should be able to categorize all actions under one of these stats.

|Stat|Examples|
|:---:|---|
|Body|strength, constitution|
|Soul|resisting magic and torture, casting magic, overcoming horrors and fears|
|Influence|persuasion, bartering with shopkeeps, underworld contacts|

Each Stat is equal to 3 + Your Rank in the skill of the same name.
In DawnStorm, when you are damaged or hurt, you will spend these Stats.
For example: damage in combat spends `Body`, verbal put-downs cost you `Influence`

**Regeneration** - Your stats regenerate after 8 hours of sleep, if you don't manage that amount, you regenerate only half if you slept at least four hours, otherwise one quarter.

**Scarring** - WHen you are out of a given stat and some event forces you to spend it, you must `Scar` yourself, or you may `Scar` yourself voluntarily.
These symbolize damage beyond something you can walk-of after a day or two.
A scar should be accompanied with recieving the effect, or finding out about it (not that it doesn't limit their Stat spending).
A `Scar` is drawn across already spent points, and gives you `2 + 2 x Each spent point`.
This wound always has a physical explanation to what it is and should affect your character even when outside combat.
The taken up points of the Stat become unusable until you deal with the problem that is connected to the `Scar`.
A `Scar's Rank` is equal to the number of points it takes up.
If an effect would grant you additional Points in a Stat, you cannot Scar these, you may only Scar your own.

|Stat + Scar Rank|Example Wound|
|:---:|---|
|Body Rank 1|Deeper cut|
|Body Rank 2|Major Food Poisoning|
|Body Rank 3|Stopped a sword with your Forearm|
|Body Rank 5|Missing Limb|
|Soul Rank 1|Small mental quirk|
|Soul Rank 5|Borderline madness|
|Influence Rank 1|Small public humiliation|
|Influence Rank 2|Nasty local rumours|
|Influence Rank 5|Denounced by ruler|

> Influence Scar's may often apply only based on location, similairly to Soul Scar's that may be temporarily triggered by something.

**Death and Unconsciousness** - Many Scar's in any stat is enough to make a character unplayable, not having any more Unscarred Points in a Stat is taken as the character being dead, crazy or unable to interact with normal people.
After suffering Scar's of a total equal to or more than a 3/4 of your Body stat, you fall unconscious.

## Skill Checks

To find your `Die Bonus` in a skill,
divide it by 2 rounded up.

To find your `Die Bonus` to an action,
find a `Skill` that most closely resembles that action, and add to it half the `Die Bonus` of its parent skill.

Add the `Die Bonus` to the `CR` and you succeed if you roll **lower** than the given total.

> If my character has Influence(6) and Performance\[Lyre\](8), and I try to impress a nobleman with a set `CR` of 8.
> I get 4 from Performance, and 1 from Influence, totalling a bonus of 5.
> So the Nobleman is impressed if I manage to roll under 13.

|CR||
|:---:|---|
|10|Normal|

**Group checks** - If you need to use a skill against a crowd, roll 4 times against the actors roll,
the whole crowd is divided on the subject based on the success rate of the rolls.

## Inventory and Items

**Makeshift** -

### Weapon Classes

Weapons apart from stated bonuses give you a free maneuver to use while wielding them.

|        Melee||
|:-------------------:| :-----:|
|  Slashing       | Accurate|
|Short Slashing|Feint|
|     Blunt       |  Powerful|
|    Piercing        |Powerful|
|Shield|Defence|

**Load** - A character may only carry a reasonable number of minor items and up to their `Body` worth of major items.
Major items being, staffs, swords,
guns, tents and the like. Every item carried above this amount gives you a `-2 Body` on skill checks.
If the item is made for a different size than you, it takes up `+2` for every size between you and the item.

## Spellcasting

A spell is made up of 3 components, the Action, the Element and the Character.
Not all must be used, sometimes more than one of each is used.

**Mana** - Most effects will ask you to spend mana, you have a basic pool equal to
your `Soul Resources`. At any time you may spend a Soul resource to
increase your current mana by your `Soul Rank`.

Magic works through
magical symbols. Spell-casters can create these circles in the air
instantaneously, however these persist only for a single round.
Long-term effects need an inscription on a surface to work,
these can be created magically, but it is very difficult.

For other spell suggestions and costs, check the [Grimoire](../grimoire).

## Combat

### Attacks

To determine the outcome of an attack, roll the attack as a skill check,
afterwards, if the defending party succeeds at a skill check with a `CR` of your attack roll,
they succesfully prevented your attack from landing.

> Dodging an attack would require a `Dexterity` check, Blocking it with a shield would depend on whether you are deflecting or absorbing the force, resulting in your `Dexterity` or `Body` Bonuses to be added respectively,

When you are hit you lose Stats, 1 by default.
If the success of the roll (CR - Roll) is by more than your enemy's skill,
you score a critical success and the enemy loses 1 additional stat for every degree of success.

1 Round of combat is 3 seconds.
If an effect would end 1 or 2 seconds into the round, either it ends 2 or 4 turns into the round,
or if the encounter has less than 4 participants, it ends immediately after your turn.

### Initiative

Combat is initiated by an attack, that creature is first in initiative and has used up its turn delivering this attack.
If one party had been ambushed, every member is automatically `Stumbled`,
otherwise the rest of the initiative cycle alternates between parties.
If one is not attacked in a round, he rises up in the Initiative by one creature.

### Maneuvers

To use a `Basic` maneuver, you spend 1 Stat.
One `Defence/Parry` per turn is free.
You cannot use more than 1 maneuver per turn (including free maneuvers) and a Defence/Parry or Feint, unless a separate effect states so.

**A - Precise** - Roll 5D6 take lowest 3

**Accurate** - Roll 4d6 take lowest 3

**A - Mighty** - Causes target to lose 3 times as much of a Stat

**Powerful** - Causes target to lose 2 times as much of a Stat

**Weak** - Causes target to lose half as much of a Stat

**Feint** - You give an ally a free Basic Maneuver against the same enemy or Kick the creature back attempting to make him stumbled or moving them

**Defence/Armor/Parry/Dodge** - You roll against the enemies attack roll + your rank in this,
if you succeed the hit is absorbed or parried and is counted as a miss,
doesn't work against magical effects by default

> A - indicates that said maneuver is `Advanced` which may be referenced by other rules. Others are called `Basic`

### Turn Actions

In a turn, you have two phases, a move and a move/action phase.
Your move allows you to move 1 + A quarter of you Speed Skill in meters.

As an action you may do one of the following:

- Attack
- Defend - Gain `Dodge 0` until the start of your next turn, but move a pace backwards or sideways when attacked
- Activate a Magic Circle
- Aid - You may roll a skill check against `CR 10`, if you succeed, an ally attempting the same check acts as if they are `Skilled`, if both of you are skilled, you may roll against `CR 12` , in which case the ally rolls as a `Master`
- Ready - Spend the round changing held items, if they're in a bag, you should spend 2 actions taking them out

## Keywords

**Area** - This shows that an action performed affects a certain area such as an explosion or cannonball. Normally this is specified as a simple length that specifies the diameter of a sphere or length of a line based on context. By default a sphere centered on you.

**CR** - The difficulty of a roll

**Range** - Range may specify an I before the distance to indicate an incorporeal effect that passes unhindered through solid objects.

**Regeneration** - The creature regains X Body resources at the start of its turn.

**Natural Armor/Mindlock/Beloved** - Expending the `Body/Soul/Influence` resource is always reduced by said amount. May specify a source in parentheses that nullifies this protection.

**Fly** - Describes Fly Speed

**Sense** - Always knows about all movement within a certain radius. It can feel generally what kind of creature it is.

**Skilled** - You subtract 1 from your roll

**Master** - You subtract 2 from your roll

**Nightvision** - Does not suffer from lack of proper lighting.

**Recharge** - You roll a D6 and if it's less than X the ability is ready to use again.

**Immunity** - The stated source cannot cause the creature to expend resources.

**Resistance** - Halve the number of resources expended due to an effect caused by this source.

**Vulnerability** - Double the number of resources expended due to an effect caused by this source.

**Stumped/Distracted** - You can't use any maneuvers, that you choose to use

### Conditions

**Stumbled** - creatures go at the end of initiative (in the order they were stumbled, if there is more than one) and cannot move more than 1 step, if they are already at the end, they move to the beginning of initiative but loose their next turn

**Short of Breath** - While you are short of breath, you can't use any `Maneuvers` with your actions that use the `Body` skill and no *Advanced Maneuvers* with actions using the `Soul` skill. If you fail an action you become *Exhausted* for the rest of the duration + *1 Round* or just *1 Round* if the `Out of Breath`'s duration is longer than a minute or 1 minute if over 1 hour.

**Exhausted** - You suffer a `-2` on all rolls per level of Exhaustion as well as all the hindrances given by `Short of Breath`.

**Restrained** -
