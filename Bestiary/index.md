# Demons

## Bone Demons

Outer shell, not regular skeleton, cranal crease

## Nightcrawler

They can teleport between two points connected by
near pitch darkness while neither is being observed. Demon dog


# Ghosts
## Demi-Ghosts
### Genius Loci
These peculiar demi-ghosts usually manifest in places of great historical or natural significance that have nonetheless been left to their own devices.
These creatures are usually very shy and rarely ever speak unless somehow directly invoked.
They have been shown to have knowledge on all matters occurring in their place of existence.
These plains of land where they exist may range from a single ruin to most of a forest.
They communicate telepathically with any sentient creatures within their domain, however to do this they must concentrate and so they loose sight of their surroundings for the time being.
A very powerful Genius Loci was once recorded to speak audibly directly through a human, both of whom shortly lost consciousness afterwards, however this is only hearsay.

### Lost Souls

Glass ball, crazy, can see anything around them, can communi-
cate telepathically on touch, they agree to anything as long as
you agree to break its casing afterwards, many havenâ€™t done so
but they try with anyone

### Mirra

mirror, with magic signs embedded in the wood, the glass re-
flects a perfect copy of a person present at casting, it is a copy of
their memories, it cannot form new ones or lose old ones through
non-magical means.

# Humanoids
## Keinfolk
Incredibly proud, stubborn and loyal creatures, described mostly as humanoid lions.
Pride upon pride, their mane is what defines their class, long and wavy manes always giving an advantage when arriving in any Keinfolk society.

## Parfolk
They are significantly smaller than humans, about half their size on average, up to three quarters with higher individuals.
They usually seem extremely subservient, but this is due to cowardice and the willingness to adapt.
As you may have guessed, their culture doesn't know honour or anything of the sort, a goal is achieved by any means necessary and survival is the only thing that may be more important than the mission.

## Talach
Tall, with pointed ears, humble and noble, truly a beloved race by most anyone who meets them.
Their curiosity and fantasy had made them into popular artists and poets, out of their cities often kept in castles and manors by nobility due to this affinity.
Their intelligence hasn't been perceived to be high nor their strength or speed, manual dexterity is the one thing they have and which no other race may rival them in.
		
## Talkin
They are very similar to the Talach, however their ears are significantly flatter, lower, sometimes almost horizontal.
Quite sly, sneaky and adept at close range combat they make excellent spies and thieves and are often employed as such.

## Tylluan
The Tylluan  are to owls what the keinfolk are to lions.

# Leviathans

# Reptiles
## Basilisk
A Basilisk is a solitary eight legged reptile-like creature.
At first it walks on all eight, later in live however, when its body is strong enough to support this development, it's head and front limbs move upwards and elongate, eventually creating an upright upper body.

**Growth Cycle**
The most magnificent property of the Basilisk is its growth cycle.
A Basilisk gives birth to a live baby no larger than a few inches.
The Basilisk then grows inexplicably rapidly as the Basilisk consumes massive amount of sustenance.
At the size of about triple that of a human the Basilisk develops an upright upper body and loses much of the potency of its breath.
When it reaches such a size that its legs are struggling to support the body, it migrates to a large body of water.
Even if it hunts enough food, which is rarely the case, its size forces it to continuously move to ever deeper water, eventually crushing it.

**Breath**
The legends often speak of the Basilisk's noxious breath.
It has been observed to have the ability to wither small plants and to accelerate corrosion of metal.
Any effects beyond this are empty claims.

**Gaze**

## Dragons

## Wyverns
Wyverns are very feral animals, true beasts fully devoted to that state of behaviour.
None have ever been recorded to reason or speak unlike dragons, this is very important to know for any adventurer that may by any chance encounter this menace.
The distinguishing feature is that it has only four limbs, two legs and two wings, and is inherently non-magical.
At the end of each wing it has claws that it may use to clamber up surfaces.
They come in many forms and colors, though most often seen in the black form, which is also the most adept at climbing.
Unlike dragons, most Wyverns do not possess a fiery breath, only the red kind is famously capable of this feat.

**Eggs**
Their eggs grow in size as the Wyvern inside matures, being laid at about half their final size.
For this reason the surface is much softer than one would at first assume, and if even the softness of the shell is not enough the egg may crack at regular intervals exposing the inner membrane.

**Weaknesses**
You may be tempted to slash the underside of the head, however unlike dragons, Wyverns have solid armour covering the entire head.
The two weakest points are their thigh joints and the point where their patagia connect to the body as it has been discovered to easily tear in the first section.
When the wings are folded however the patagia is relaxed, elastic and quite difficult to pierce without an exceptionally sharp weapon.
