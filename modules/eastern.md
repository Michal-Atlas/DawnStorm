## Professions

### Kineticist

For every Tier in this class,
you add 2 hands to your arsenal.
These hands are ethereal and
while not in use, the hands cannot be seen without magical means.
Each hand can carry up to 8 times 2 to the power of your Tier kilograms.
It cannot be separated more than 1 meter from you and may become incorporeal at will.
You may not be able to concentrate on full control of this form,
for every Soul Stat you can control one hand,
or your own two hands in your turn.
