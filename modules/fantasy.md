### Spellcasting

Magic works through magical glyphs.
Spell-casters can create these glyphs in mid-air instantaneously,
however these persist only for a single round.
Long-term effects need an inscription on a surface to work.

**Mana** - Most effects will ask you to spend mana, you have a basic pool equal to your `Soul`.
At any time you may scar a `Soul` stat to reset your mana back to that number
(this does not let you spend more than your maximum mana on one spell).

## Magic

### Spells

When casting a spell you declare,
a Motion and optionally an Element you know (collectively called words of power),
and what the desired outcome is.
Not all elements are useful with all motions.

If your character recieved damage in the last round, you get a cumulative `+2`  to spell `RD` for every `Stat` you lost.
Having restrained hands adds a `+4` to the spell `RD`.

Having plenty of time to draw a magic glyph Reduces the difficulty and cost of the spell, both by 1 per 10 minutes, but up to your die roll modifier for spellcasting.

#### Motions

Motions all have multiple Tiers with an `RD` and a `Mana` cost.
When casting a spell with the given motion's tier, you first deduct that much `Mana` from your pool, then roll against that `RD` to determine if the spell was successfull.

Failing the spell doesn't immediately mean nothing happened, your `degree of failure` determine that:

|Degree of failure|Effect|
|:---:|---|
|1-2|Slightly altered effect if possible, otherwise Failed spell|
|3-6|Failed Spell|
|7+|The spell backfires, GMs decision|

Tier Guidelines:

- **Tier I \[`RD10`, `1Mana`\]**: Achievable within the hour with sufficient skill and tools, the effect vanishes within 10 minutes
- **Tier II \[`RD6`, `5Mana`\]**: Apparently magical effects, mostly on inanimate objects or a small group of about 3 to 5 beings, or advanced effects such as manipulation on one person
- **Tier III \[`RD0`, `XMana`\]**: Complex effects, extending to supernatural, manipulating reality with portals and short-range teleportation
- **Tier IV \[`RD-2`, `XMana + Soul Scar`\]**:
- **Tier V \[`RD-4`, `Soul Scar`\]**: Miracles

Motions:

- Cease
  - **Tier I**: Stop the movement of an unattended object up to the size of a travelling cart
  - **Tier II**: Cease the movement of an object or cease the existence of an unattended object up to the size of a travelling cart
- Command
  - **Tier I**: Compel a calm animal to perform some action
- Create
  - **Tier I**: Spontaneously create an item no bigger than the width of your hand, creatable from resources that you are touching.
  - **Tier II**: The item, must not exceed your outstretched arms length in any dimension.
- Destroy
- Divide/Dislocate
  - **Tier I**: Cut with your finger an inanimate object as if it were a knife.
  - **Tier IV**: Cut Metaphysical concepts

- Scry

- Stride
- Summon
- Transmute

#### Elements

If the spell doesn't contain a corresponding Element for the effect,
you are limited to `Tier I` and `II` spells.
Some Elements will contain an `RD` modifier.

Elements:

- Body
- Cold / Ice
- Earth
- Fire / Heat
- Metal
- Mind
- Nature
- Necros (Necromantic)
- Spectra (Supernatural)
- Time
- Water

**Fey** - All effects are performed by nearby plants

**HexBlade** - The magic is limited only to the wearer himself and mainly his weapon and armour

**Artistic** - The effects must all be based on art, animate and move small objects, or create illusions

**Shadow** -

### Magic Glyphs

A magic glyph is created by inscribing a Motion and an Element, with a very specific intention into a solid surface and empowering them with a `Soul` or `Soul Fragment`.
Mechanically, this requires you to succesfully cast the spell,
and either lower your maximum `Mana` until it's destroyed or empty a `Soul Stone` into it.
Your maximum `Mana` returns to you after the destruction of the item or the use of a one use item.
If you used your own `Soul Fragment`, the item recharges when your `Mana` refreshes.

It takes `1 second` per `1 Mana` to create a glyph.
If the item is created with a soul from a `Soul Stone`,
it is recharged by draining mana into the item at a rate of `1 Mana` per second
(this mana is normally spent as if casting a spell).
At Dawn and Dusk, a glyph is sealed and cannot be expanded, only recharged.

Spending additional time and resources during casting (activation), makes the casting cheaper and easier.
Reducing the cost by `1 Mana` and increasing the `DR` by 1,
costs `10 Silver` of magical materials and `10 Minutes` times 3 to the power of the amount reduced.

When activated, the glyph casts the spell, draining from the enclosed mana pool.
If the creature that activates a glyph is a magic user with a `Character`, the spell is cast with that character.
You may also designate a sound or simple occurence (such as someone stepping on it) that activates the glyph automatically.

> Since speech doesn't take up an action, this allows you to activate glyphs outside you turn.

**Soul Stone** -
You may substitute a Fragment of your own Soul for a Soul from a Soul Stone.
This allows you to create a glyph without lowering your own maximum `Mana`,
but limits the `Mana` capacity to that of the Soul used.
Soul Stones are quite rare, and have a limited capacity,
however they are reusable.

**Scrolls** -
Scrolls produce a one-time Spell effect, they don't require a `skill check` but still cost mana.
Afterwards, the papyrus disintegrates.
Creating one takes 10 minutes per Tier and
requires you to succesfully cast the spell per the Magic Glyph rules.

**Analyzing Magic** -
Perceiving a magic glyph, even an instantaneous one let's you identify any word of power that you know.
Identifying those you don't know, requires a knowledge (arcane) check and some time and concentration with the glyph or a page of notes you made about it.
Learning a word of power requires several days, of study and experimentation with notes from several glyphs,
with a `RD` of the number of different notes you're analyzing that have a word in them that you know.

**Enchanting Items** -
Items are Enchanted with tiny magic-glyphs that require about double time and complete concentration.
When a magic-glyph is on an item that can be entirely lifted by you single-handedly,
it can be activated while touching any point of the item.

**Countering Spells** -
You may `Dispel` a non-magic-glyph spell as a `Defence` maneuver or an `Action`.
Dispelling takes half the `Mana` of the spell and
a roll of `RD` of the spell `+3` or `+1` if you know the motion.

**God Invoking** -
Outside these boundaries lies Divine magic.
Monks and priests, worship and directly invoke a magical being.
Others must use complex rituals to win their interest.
Divine magic cannot be understood by non-divine casters at all.
