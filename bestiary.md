## Recommended Playable Humanoids

### Human

Nothing special, the perfect blank slate.

### Goblin

Size: `Small`

### Keinfolk

**Kein Roar** - Once a day, you are able to Roar so loud that any creatures within a 30 meter radius, must succeed at an `RD 9` Check, or become `Frightened` of you for 6 Seconds.

Incredibly proud, stubborn and loyal creatures, described mostly as humanoid lions.
Pride upon pride, their mane is what defines their class, long and
wavy manes always giving an advantage when arriving in any Keinfolk society.

### Talach

**Talach talent** - You are a `Master` at one form of art and `Skilled` in another.

Tall, with pointed ears, humble and noble, truly a beloved race by most anyone who meets them.
Their curiosity and fantasy had made them into popular artists and poets, outside their cities often kept in castles and manors by nobility due to this affinity.
Their intelligence hasn't been perceived to be high nor their strength, manual dexterity is the one thing they have and which no other race may rival them in.

### Talkin

**Talkin Ear** - Your ears are very sensitive to whispers and murmurs.
When listening to someone in a crowded room, you hear as if the room was silent.

They are very similar to the Talach, however their ears are significantly flatter, lower, sometimes almost horizontal.
Quite sly, sneaky and adept at close range combat, they make excellent spies and thieves and are often employed as such.

### Tylluan

**Tylluan Sight** - You have `NightVision`

The Tylluan are to owls what the keinfolk are to lions.

## Beasts

### Warthorg

## Celestials

### Angel

## Demons

### Bone Demons

The bone demons are the knights of the nine hells, they are sent to retrieve souls that are expected to pose ressistance.
They stand about 2 metres tall, carry a great-shield and a slightly curved broadsword or lance, as well as two daggers lodged into a cavity in their hips.
Their outer appearance is that of a knight, whose plate armour has a surface similair to a bones.
It's head has a fleshy mouth, and then a split into two flat protrusions to each side.
If the bone demon's plates should come apart you may see that the inside is actually mostly empty, and held together by occassional oozing strands, the only physical part being the mouth.

### Dreadlords

### Nightcrawler

These dog-like creatures are mostly used by other demons for spying, hunting and disposing of targets.
Their visage is quite simple, the front half is that of a wolf up until their back legs and hips, which are just black smoke and non-visible.
Their eyes reflect light in anything but the darkest of places, the light changes color based on the demon it is currently serving.
If a mortal ever manages to calm and tame a nightcrawler, the smoke coming from its back changes to bright blue and it becomes apparent that their non-feral nature is quite playful.

**Blinking**
They can teleport between two points connected by
near pitch darkness while neither is being observed.

### Oni

## Fey

### Changelings

Changelings are the infiltrators of the Fey, they can change their body to the visage of any humanoid they see at least indirectly.
They are born by imbuing an unborn child with Fey magic.
The family usually doesn't know about this, until the Fey visit the child at 18 years old, informing it of its destiny.
This arduous process is mostly so that the Changeling blends in as well as possible with other creatures.
When a changeling dies, it reverts to its original form.

### Dryad

### Fey Lord

### Fey Queen

### Krypsaker

A fey being of intense resilience, it resembles a humanoid,
but it seems as to be disfigured into a goblin-like form,
with sharp teeth and pointed uneven ears and nails.
At any point it can turn parts of itself into insects or birds and
Even a single one of these may with enough nourishment create a whole Krypsaker once more.

### Pan / Pixie

The most common of the Fey, often incorrectly called forest nymphs, Pans and their female counterparts called Pixies inhabit kingdoms in many forests of the world.
Their philosophy of life is inherently pacifistic, created by the titan gaya to protect the forests, the damage of which is the only way to aggravate them.

They carry human chests and heads, usually with antlers and animal eyes and ears.
Their legs bend backwards above the knee bending backwards before heading to the ground once more and ending in hooves.
Most of their bodies are covered and seem to be made of leaves, branches and vines, same as their tools and homes.
Being gaya's chosen all wildlife listens and bends to the needs of the pan.

#### Shadow Pan

#### Hag

## Ghosts

### Animated Armour

### Genius Loci

These peculiar demi-ghosts usually manifest in places of great historical or natural significance that have nonetheless been left to their own devices.
These creatures are usually very shy and rarely ever speak unless somehow directly invoked.
They have been shown to have knowledge on all matters occurring in their place of existence.
These plains of land where they exist may range from a single ruin to most of a forest.
They communicate telepathically with any sentient creatures within their domain, however to do this they must concentrate and so they loose sight of their surroundings for the time being.
A very powerful Genius Loci was once recorded to speak audibly directly through a human, both of whom shortly lost consciousness afterwards, however this is only hearsay.

### Rage

### Spectra

### Wendigo

### Will-o'-Wisp

### Demi-Ghosts

#### Lost Soul

Lost Souls is a general term for souls that have been prevented from leaving the world, usually through trapping them inside a container, very commonly glass spheres or stones.
When touching the container one may telepathically communicate with the soul trapped within.
It is said that the feeling of being a lost soul is like being restrained and gagged, however you see everything that goes on around you.
If left alone for long enough the soul usually goes crazy within a few weeks, thus they always wish to be released and will trade next to any help they can provide for you letting them go.
Cracking or opening a container of the soul, releases it.

**Magic**
Lost souls are often used by spellcasters, because the mana of the original creature still resides within their soul.
The soul however, cannot regenerate mana without the body and so is one use only.
*Note* Please break your soul stones after use.

#### Mirra

Mirras are perfect copies of a creature's conciousness from a certain point.
They are created via a spell etched into the wooden part of a mirror, binding a present creature to the object, which then shows in its reflection the bound creature's reflection.
The reflection moves around the room and can talk and recall all the memories of the original creature, its maneurism and personality are also the same.
The Mirra cannot create new memories or create new impressions on people, it is always just a perfect copy, however it may utilize very short term memory or connect concepts to changes in the room which it may ask you to make.
The Mirra recalls existing memories perfectly and instantaneously.

## Reptiles

### Basilisk

A Basilisk is a solitary eight legged reptile-like creature.
At first it walks on all eight, later in life however, when its body is strong enough to support this development, it's head and front limbs move upwards and elongate, eventually creating an upright upper body.

**Growth Cycle**
The most magnificent property of the Basilisk is its growth cycle.
A Basilisk gives birth to a live baby no larger than a few inches.
The Basilisk then grows inexplicably rapidly as the Basilisk consumes massive amount of sustenance.
At the size of about triple that of a human the Basilisk develops an upright upper body and loses much of the potency of its breath.
When it reaches such a size that its legs are struggling to support the body, it migrates to a large body of water.
Even if it hunts enough food, which is rarely the case, its size forces it to continuously move to ever deeper water, eventually crushing it.

**Breath**
The legends often speak of the Basilisk's noxious breath.
It has been observed to have the ability to wither small plants and to accelerate corrosion of metal.
Any effects beyond this are empty claims.

**Gaze**
...

### Dragon

Every dragons has the ability to transform into a humanoid.

### Wyvern

Wyverns are very feral animals, true beasts fully devoted to that state of behaviour.
None have ever been recorded to reason or speak unlike dragons, this is very important to know for any adventurer that may by any chance encounter this menace.
The distinguishing feature is that it has only four limbs, two legs and two wings, and is inherently non-magical.
At the end of each wing it has claws that it may use to clamber up surfaces.
They come in many forms and colors, though most often seen in the black form, which is also the most adept at climbing.
Unlike dragons, most Wyverns do not possess a fiery breath, only the red kind is famously capable of this feat.

**Eggs**
Their eggs grow in size as the Wyvern inside matures, being laid at about half their final size.
For this reason the surface is much softer than one would at first assume, and if even the softness of the shell is not enough the egg may crack at regular intervals exposing the inner membrane.

**Weaknesses**
You may be tempted to slash the underside of the head, however unlike dragons, Wyverns have solid armour covering the entire head.
The two weakest points are their thigh joints and the point where their patagia connect to the body as it has been discovered to easily tear in the first section.
When the wings are folded however the patagia is relaxed, elastic and quite difficult to pierce without an exceptionally sharp weapon.

#### Sgrechian

This breed of Wyverns is extremely rare.
Usually artificially enchanted for combat purposes.
They naturally have two main characteristics, their speed, and their scream.
Though lacking a beath, they are able to surpass the sound barrier, by a tiny amount.
Their head is often enchanted with a spell that protects them from impact,
it activates with their scream.
Their scream can be heard miles around and has deafened many who were too close,
it is described as being extremely high-pitched,
yet still powerful enough to be felt deep in the guts.
